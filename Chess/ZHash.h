//! Zobrist Hashing Calculator.
//!
//! Zobrist Hashing is used to encode the state of a chess game in a single number. There is a risk of two unrelated states
//! having the same value. In this implementation, the value has 64 bits and the risk of collision can be assumed to be
//! very low, though not for a large number of values. The probability of at least one collision with 1 million values
//! is 2.710502Ã—10<sup>-8</sup>, but with 1 billion values, it rises to 1 in 40.
//!
//! There are 6 components of state. This implementation of Zorbrist hashing incorporates most of them.
//!     1. Piece placement
//!     2. Active color
//!     3. Castling availability
//!     4. En-passant possibility
//!     5. Fifty-move rule
//!     6. Number of moves (this is ignored because it is not useful and it interferes with transposition optimization)
//!
//! An important characteristic of a Zorbrist hash is that it is independent of the order of the changes made to reach the state.
